Hi there! I’m Augusto Accorsi, but my friends call me Guto. Having worked in software development for almost 10 years, I have tried quite a few areas before discovering the developer I want to be is a frontend engineer or a full-stack developer. Everything started with HTML and CSS of course, that software coding was a brave new world for me. After that, I found myself with ABAP, trying to navigate in the sea of enterprise software.

Nonetheless, I realized that my real passion was frontend development, which means dealing with JavaScript and, later, Node.js. Since then, I have acquired rich experience in developing user interfaces from scratch, starting from responsive layouts to performance understanding . While my primary field of expertise is still frontend development, my knowledge and experience allow me to design quality software and find the optimal points for various parts of the project.

I am looking forward to sharing my experience and empowering other enthusiasts in their coding odysseys both professionally and beyond. In case you are curious about my career path, projects, or guidance you can replicate in this area, you are welcome to review my [resume](https://github.com/augustoaccorsi/augustoaccorsi/blob/main/resume/resume.pdf). I am excited to connect with you, work together, and inspire innovation in the software development field.
